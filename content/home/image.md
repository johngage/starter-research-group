Dominic Lokinyomo, a 20 year old refugee athlete under the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation refugee supprot program and who performed excellently at the January 2019 Athletics Kenya Cross-Country series in Kisii County, has been featured by one of our partners, the International Association of Athletics Federations, on their website. It is a story of resilience, passion and a belief in himself. Although he’s just a few months into his twenties, Lokinyomo is already a veteran of three international refugee team appearances, part of a fledgling career that seemed beyond any realm of possibility a decade ago.

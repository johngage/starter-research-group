From the foundation’s work in promoting peace through sports in refugee camps in Kenya, It was discovered that there were many talented athletes in the camp, but they had no options to further their careers. 

Ambassador Tegla Loroupe therefore decided to speak with Thomas Bach, The President of the International Olympic Committee, about the possibility of creating a refugee team, as a joint initiative with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, the UNHCR Agency, . This led to the establishment of a training centre for refugee athletes in Ngong (within the outskirts of Nairobi). Five of the refugee athletes from South Sudan quaified for the Refugee Olympic Team in Rio.

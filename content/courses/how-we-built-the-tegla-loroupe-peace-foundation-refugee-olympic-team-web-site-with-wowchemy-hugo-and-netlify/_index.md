title: How To Build the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation Refugee Olympic Team Web
  Site with Wowchemy, Hugo, and Netlify

subtitle: Overview of Major Components,  followed by Step By Step Guide
summary: >-
  Wowchemy is a set of templates for creating and publishing a static website
  specialized for academic research and research groups. The templates are built
  using Hugo components--pages, posts, books, biographies, events, images,
  galleries--software programs that convert various kinds of content into HTML
  pages ready to publish. Hugo establishes the framework for the website--the
  directories and subdirectories that contain text, images, bibliographic
  entries, biographical entries, and the software programs that control their
  appearance--Javascript programs, configuration files, CSS files, HTML files,
  scripting language programs.


  Interaction with these directory structures, templates, and software components can be very high-level, dealing only with editing text and uploading images, or can go deeper, allowing the fine-tuning of individual components.  


  This discussion begins at the high level, allowing immediate editing of an existing web site, and explores the expansion and modification of the web site (and troubleshooting any errors) by a series of examples.

Here is a description by George Cushen of his project to build a framework for creating a static web site in a short [outline](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) published in December, 2020.

Here's his promise: 

George Cushen:     In this guide, you’ll learn **how to create a free website for your online portfolio, resumé, or your team/organization using just your web browser**.

Read his [outline](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/) .  In what follows, I will expand on his statements, explaining what works, what is still under development, and what requires a deeper understanding of how the components interact.  I will point out the  pathways to build that deeper understanding through online tutorials on software development and developer tools.

I have used his description to set up the recreation of **teglapeacefoundation.org** as it existed in mid-2019.  I recreated it from snapshots taken by the Webarchive Foundation.

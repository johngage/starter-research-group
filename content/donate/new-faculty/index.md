The  Kapenguria Peace Academy teaches classes for orphan, refugee, and local children.  Over three hundred students attend classes.  More than half reside in dormitories at the main campus in Kapenguria.

Forty faculty, half employed by the National Teacher Union and the National Ministry of Education, the other half employed privately, teach Forms One through Six.

We support three interrelated projects: the Refugee Olympic Team Training Center in Ngong, Kenya; the Peace Academy, a K-8 school for orphans from the conflict areas in North Kenya in Kapenguria, Kenya; and a Warrior's Training Camp, for reformed warriors committed to live peacefully, developing skills in farming and ranching, in Kapenguria.

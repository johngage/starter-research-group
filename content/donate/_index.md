We support three interrelated projects: the **Refugee Olympic Team Training Center** in Ngong, Kenya; the **Peace Academy**, a K-8 school for orphans from the conflict areas in North Kenya in Kapenguria, Kenya; and a **Warrior's Training Camp**, for reformed warriors committed to live peacefully, developing skills in farming and ranching, in Kapenguria.

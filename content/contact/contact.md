The Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation main office is in Nairobi, in a new location in Lavington.  For ten years, the office was on the second floor of the main office building at Shalom House, close to Ngong Road, near Junction. In late 2020, the office moved to its current location. The [Tegla Loroupe Olympic Refugee Training Camp](http://bit.ly/37Y0sc3) is located in the town of Ngong, fifteen kilometers to the west of Nairobi.

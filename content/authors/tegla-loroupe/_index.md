Tegla Loroupe (9 May 1973 – ) is a former Kenyan long-distance track and road runner. She was the first African woman to win the New York City Marathon. She won twice, once with the highest temperature recorded for the New York Marathon, once with the lowest temperature recorded.  She has held many world records.

Loroupe holds the world records for 20, 25 and 30 kilometres and previously held the world marathon record. She is the three-time World Half-Marathon champion.  She has won marathons in London, Boston, Rotterdam, Hong Kong, Berlin, Rome and many other cities.

In 2003, she started the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation and has been an active advocate for peace. She has been successful in bringing members of warring tribes together. In 2006, she founded the 10km Peace Race, which included 2,000 warriors from six different tribes. Loroupe said the motivation for the race was to use her fame to help bring about greater harmony.

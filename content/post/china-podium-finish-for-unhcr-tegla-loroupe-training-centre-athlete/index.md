PODIUM FINISH FOR TEGLA LOROUPE TRAINING CENTRE ATHLETE A Kenyan athlete, Hosea Simotwo, who is part of the UNHCR/ Tegla Loroupe Athletics Project in Ngong, Kenya, came second at the Cross-strait (Kunshan) Marathon

A Kenyan athlete, Hosea Simotwo, who is part of the UNHCR/ Tegla Loroupe Athletics Project in Ngong, Kenya, came second at the Cross-strait (Kunshan) Marathon in Kunshan City, China on Sunday, March 24 2019. Hosea, who also came first at the Beverly Round Lihu Lake International Half-Marathon in Wuxi City, China in November 2018, has been in fine form lately, thanks to the rigorous training regime at the Ngong Training Centre.   For his efforts in the race that attracted about 10,000 runners, Hosea (in blue track suit) received Yuan 5,000 (about Kshs. 75,000) . Once again this is clear evidence that inclusion benefits both refugees and host community member.

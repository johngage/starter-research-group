In a few days, Tegla will lead a video team through the Ngong Training Camp.  And the web page will let people donate to support anything they like.

And Lam will help move donations from Airbnb to the TLPF bank account. We will have millions of Ksh come to help build the training track and a library and a computer center for the athletes.

### It's a new day
- I've just renamed the Github repository
But will creating a new repository with the same old name cause trouble?
The git files seem to work, so I can edit on my computer, using Atom; then push through Git to Github.

Or edit using the Netlify editor.

Or edit on Github, with the Github editor.

Still can't figure out how to add images to posts.

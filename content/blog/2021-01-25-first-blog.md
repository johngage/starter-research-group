description: "try to see content in Academic "
---
The first round of building the Netlify site used Wowchemy to create the Github repository, and link it to Netlify.  Then, configuring the Netlify CMS editor relies on a config.yml file in the site to allow the editor to see all the Academic content on the Github site.

But that file was missing.

So I downloaded it from a Github site that displays a sample site. Suddenly, I could see the home page, see the authors, see people....and now I have to learn how to add new images to existing pages.

Separately, I downloaded an Academic site to my computer; installed Hugo, and executed "hugo server", which created a site, and put it up on a web page at "localhost:49840".  It shows a 2019 page, so I expect the config.yml file to be old.

Editing on Github does not show up on the Netlify site.  Why?

And the Netlifycms error has come back:
Git Gateway Error: Please ask your site administrator to reissue the Git Gateway token.
